            <p>Well, You know; Almost everyone uses my app in my school; Even our math teacher. At first this was a windows app named "Maths" written in VB.Net. As the result it was
            a very slow ass application. I noticed myself that it's really hard to turn on the PC to just factorize a number. So I thought of creating this app for smart phones.
            I started with Android and done it. But when I published that on school, most of my friends asked me for iOS version. Well, for developing iOS applications you must have
            XCode and that must be installed on OSX. I couldn't afford a Mac, so I installed OSX on my PC(On Boot). It was a disaster! 90% Of times I couldn't connect to internet!
            I hardly download xCode and installed it. But then I faced a big problem: Apple Enrollment. {You must pay 100$ to apple in order to publish the application}. WAIT, WHAT?
            After I find out there is no other way to publish the app, I left the project. Today, one year after that, I finished a site to do exact same calculations I had in my android
            application.<br>2 years later I started to code the app in Xamarin and publish it in Sibapp. This time, I installed mac os on VM Ware. After I fully build the application, I realized
            that I have to  pay 99$ to apple again. Well that was a great waste of time.<br>So, basically <strong>FUCK APPLE</strong>!<br>Months later, I used someone's else account to publish my 
            app at sibapp! Thanks pal and fuck Apple!<br> Here are some <del>good</del> MOTHER FUCKING friends that forced me to built this for iOS. They <i>were</i> so such a nice friends.
